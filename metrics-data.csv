discovery_calls,inputs,Live,41,Discovery Calls,,,This metric tracks the number of structured interviews and discovery sessions conducted with data and analytics colleagues in Brambles. The discovery calls span the full range of data specialisms including data analysis visualisation analytics and data engineering data science and machine learning process automation and DataOps. These calls are important for uncovering the full scope of analytics tools in Brambles including shadow tool deployments and regional solutions that may not be visible through our normal asset management systems. The quality number and coverage of discovery call directly impacts the accuracy of tool identification and evaluation against our D&A capabilities.
capabilities_defined,inputs,Live,26,D&A Capabilities Defined,,,This measures the number of distinct data and analytics business capabilities that we've formally identified and documented as part of the program framework. These capabilities represent the functional requirements that analytics tools must support such as data visualization semantic modelling or anomaly detection. Establishing a comprehensive capability framework is critical for evaluating tool overlap and determining which tools can be consolidated or eliminated without compromising business functionality.
sme_capabilities,inputs,Live,0,Managed Capabilities,,,This tracks the number of data and analytics capabilities that are actively managed and maintained by a qualified subject matter expert (SME). The stewardship of these capabilities by SMEs is an important for increasing the accuracy of tool evaluations against our requirements and improving our decision making especially when considering tool duplication and rationalisation opportunities. Active management of the capabilities (and their sub-capabilities) by SMEs will a) help keep the requirements view and priorities up to date b) track latest changes in technologies and the market c) facilitate more consistent requirements discussions across Brambles.
csat_response,inputs,Going live in Q2,tbd,CSAT Respondents,CSAT response rate:,0,This metric tracks the response rate for Customer Satisfaction (CSAT) surveys sent to analytics tool users as part of the discovery process. A high response rate is critical for obtaining representative feedback about the current tool environment and understanding user needs and pain points. The CSAT response rate helps validate that our discovery findings reflect the broader user community's experience and ensures that tool consolidation decisions are informed by comprehensive user input. This metric also serves as an indicator of user engagement with the AOM Tooling Governance program.
tools,inventory,Live,83,Tools Discovered,SysAdmins located:,4,This represents the total count of analytics tools identified across Brambles through the discovery activities. It includes commercial software tools (paid-for) and open-source tools (typically free of charge). For the current discovery phase the scope and meaning of analytics tools is a deliberately broad category on the grounds that when we have an established inventory of tools we'll be able to narrow our focus on the most important or significant aspects of the list. At present we don't know what we don't know. Building the tool inventory through discovery is the most fundamental task associated with the AOM Tool Governance workstream.
accounts,inventory,Live,7824,Tool User Accounts,,,This measures the aggregate number of individual user accounts across all discovered analytics tools. This metric helps quantify the administrative overhead and license costs associated with the current tool landscape. A high account-to-user ratio might help diagnose significant tool duplication where users maintain multiple accounts for similar functionality representing clear opportunities for consolidation and cost reduction. User accounts are essential for evaluating migration needs as part of our tool rationalisation or consolidation. The ability to reach tool users and engage with them to obtain views understand workloads and plan migrations is a critical aspect of our change management.
users,inventory,Live,915,Unique Users,,,This counts the distinct individuals who have access to analytics tools regardless of how many different tools they use. This metric provides insight into the actual user base size and helps calculate per-user tool costs. Understanding the relationship between unique users and total tool accounts reveals the extent of tool fragmentation and guides decisions about which tools should be retained based on their user adoption and business criticality.
commercial,inventory,Live,54,Commercial Tools,Found in Coupa or Zycus:,78,This tracks the number of licensed commercial analytics software products in use across the Brambles. Commercial tools represent the largest cost component in our analytics technology stack and will often have the most standardised functionality making them good candidates for consolidation efforts. The commercial tool list will be the core space for the Tooling Governance processes. Usually but not always commercial tools will have data entries in our Coupa and Zycus systems which will help us understand and evaluate usage of the tool.
opensource,inventory,Live,29,Open Source Tools,,,This measures the count of open-source analytics tools identified during our discovery work. While these tools may have lower usually zero direct costs they sometimes consume significant internal support resources and can create technical debt if not properly managed. There is typically increased security concern associated with open-source tools along with issues arising from unmanaged data and compute consumption. In scope terms this is a large category with a very long tail of different tools which blur into individual software libraries or components. Understanding the footprint of open-source tools helps assess the total cost of ownership and technical risk associated with the Brambles analytics environment.
spend,inventory,Going live in Q2,$ tbd,FY26 Tool Spend,Discovered tools covered:,2,This represents the total projected expenditure on in-scope analytics tools for this financial year including license fees support costs and infrastructure expenses. This metric establishes the financial baseline for measuring rationalisation benefits and will help justify migration program investments. Accurate spend tracking is essential for calculating return on investment and demonstrating the financial impact of tool consolidation efforts to the business. This metric is a hybrid of hybrid of historic tool spend on analytics tools discovered from our financial ledger and procurement systems and project spend from our budget processes.
savings,outcomes,Going live in Q2,$ tbd,Savings Achieved,,,This metrics records the financial benefits realised through tool rationalization activities including eliminated license costs reduced support expenses and avoided infrastructure. This metric demonstrates the tangible business value delivered by the program and validates the investment in migration and retirement activities. Achieved savings provide evidence of the effectiveness of the program and may help support future migration activities.
potential,outcomes,Going live in Q2,$ tbd,Potential Savings,,,This quantifies the predicted financial benefits that could be realised through identified rationalisation opportunities that have been identified but not yet approved or implemented. This forward-looking metric helps prioritise future program activities and demonstrates the remaining value available through continued tool consolidation efforts. Potential savings analysis informs resource allocation decisions and timeline planning for optimisation initiatives.
csat,outcomes,Going live in Q2,tbd,Tool User CSAT,,,This metrics measures analytics tool user satisfaction levels with the current analytics tool environment typically gathered through surveys and feedback sessions. Tool user satisfaction is a critical success factor for rationalisation efforts. Our ambition is that tool consolidation must maintain or improve users' experience to ensure adoption and business continuity. We believe that this will happen through a) faster easier access to the tools b) access to better more powerful analytics functionality and c) reducing the number of handovers and integrations required between disparate tools and environments. This metric helps balance our cost optimisation objectives with user needs requirements and will help identify areas where tool improvements are needed.
retired,outcomes,Going live in Q2,tbd,Tools Retired,,,This counts the number of analytics tools that have been successfully decommissioned as part of the AOM rationalisation efforts. Tool retirement represents the most direct outcome of the program demonstrating progress toward the core objective of reducing tool sprawl. This metric indicates the program's effectiveness in executing consolidation decisions and helps track progress toward target state architecture goals.
new_tools,outcomes,Going live in Q2,tbd,New Tools Added,,,This measures analytics tools that have been newly deployed or approved during the program period. While the primary goal is rationalisation some new tools may be necessary to replace retired solutions or address capability gaps. Monitoring new tool additions ensures that rationalisation gains are not offset by continued tool proliferation and helps maintain governance discipline in tool acquisition processes.
